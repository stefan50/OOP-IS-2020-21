# OOP-IS-2020-21

This is where we will write code for our mini-project - a simple bank system.

For now, we have:
* String class

TODO:
* Vector class - or maybe not
* Other classes for our project

Timetable:
* Week 1 - basic string methods (getters, setters, constructor, destructor)
* Week 2 - Copy constructor and assignment operator. Define our project topic
* Week 3 - Many operators - eq, ord, index operator
* Week 4 - We talked about streams and operators connected with them. We defined what we needed - epics, features and user stories for our project. Used GitHub's Kanban board.
* Week 5 - We need to make sure we are ready for the upcoming exam. We can overload << and >>

Future Timetable:

# OOP-IS-2020-21

This is where we will write code for our mini-project - a simple bank system.

For now, we have:
* String class

TODO:
* Vector class
* Other classes for our project

Timetable:
* Week 1 - basic string methods (getters, setters, constructor, destructor)
* Week 2 - Copy constructor and assignment operator. Define our project topic
* Week 3 - Many operators - eq, ord, index operator

Future Timetable:
* Week 4 - We will talk about streams and operators connected with them. We need to define what we need - epics, features and user stories for our project. Maybe show them GitHub's Kanban board?
